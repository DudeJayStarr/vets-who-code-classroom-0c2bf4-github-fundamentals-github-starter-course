# My GitHub Fundamentals Course Feedback

## What I Learned

- How to create and clone repositories
- Basic git commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`
- How to open a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub
- The importance of commit messages and staging changes
- Collaboration workflows using forks and branches

## What I'm Still Confused About

- Best practices for handling merge conflicts
- When to use branches versus working directly on `main`
- Advanced Git commands like `rebase` and `cherry-pick`

---

### Fun Experimenting with Styles

- **Bold text** to emphasize important points  
- *Italic text* for subtle notes  
- `Inline code` for commands and filenames  
- Blockquotes for quotes or important notes:

> "Commit early, commit often."

- Lists to organize ideas  
- Horizontal rules to separate sections

Thanks for this great course! Looking forward to mastering Git more.
